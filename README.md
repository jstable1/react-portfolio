# React Portfolio

## Description
This project is my portfolio built with React. I built 7 components and added logic to conditionally render them based on user click events.

## Technologies Used
  * React.js
  * HTML
  * CSS
  
## User Experience
Users are able to click on the 4 different links at the top and will be taken to that specific page on the website. The portfolio page shows 6 web applications I have built and has icons that will take the user to either the application or the github page for the application. The contact page has a contact box to reach me. The resume page has a clickable link to my resume.
